# Cpp_Fundamentals
This is my Cpp Fundamentals repo.

This is my C++ repo. for fundamentals.

even though i still have stock knowledge id prefer going back from zero.

I would be soon go for carbon, Zig, or even Nim when i have much more experience.

I donnt just go change programming language because of profession.

i change language because of the need of experience and there are lots of resources out there for me to learn.
